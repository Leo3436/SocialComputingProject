# SocialComputingProject
This project was made for a Social Computing university course. The assignment was to make a web of twitter accounts and analyze it.   
The starting point of the web were 5 accounts from which we randomly picked 5 followers and 5 followings. Then from those random accounts we added 10 more random followers and followings. 
All users that were used in this project are stored in the "data" folder in json format.
